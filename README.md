# Kargul Starter

Next.js 16 + React 19 + Tailwind CSS 4 boilerplate. Read `CONVENTIONS.md` before writing any component, section, or page — it is the whole spec for how this repo is built.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

| Script                 | What it does                                                       |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `npm run dev`          | Start the dev server                                               |
| `npm run build`        | Production build                                                   |
| `npm run start`        | Serve the production build                                         |
| `npm run lint`         | ESLint                                                             |
| `npm run to:avif`      | Convert an image to AVIF and report its inline cost — rule 11      |
| `npm run extract:avif` | Pull the first frame of every `.webm` under `public/` as a poster  |
| `npm run frame:rive`   | Render a still from a `.riv` file for use as its poster            |

## First things to set on a new project

1. **`lib/seo.ts`** — `SITE_NAME`, `SITE_URL`, `SITE_DESCRIPTION`, `SITE_ROUTES`. Everything in `app/robots.ts`, `app/sitemap.ts`, `app/llms.txt/route.ts` and every page's metadata derives from these (rule 18). Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` in the environment to override the URL per deploy.
2. **`app/globals.css`** — match the `@layer base` type scale and the `--padding-section-*` tokens to the design before building anything (rules 1 and 3).
3. **`app/opengraph-image.jpg`** — 1200×630, with an `opengraph-image.alt.txt` beside it.
4. **Fonts** — `app/layout.tsx` ships Inter + a local Inter Display; swap them for the design's typeface.
